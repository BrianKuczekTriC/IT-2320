        <h1>Building Your Own PC</h1>

		<p>

		Most people will look at a computer and see a machine that they feel is way too advanced for them to
		understand. I'm going to show you how relatively simple it is and how to do it yourself. I will be
		focusing on desktop Computers.
			
		</p>

        <h2>All parts necessary</h2>
		
		<ul>
		
		<li>Case</li>
		<li>CPU</li>
		<li>GPU</li>
		<li>Motherboard</li>
		<li>Power Supply</li>
		<li>RAM</li>
		<li>Harddrive</li>
		<li>Monitor</li>
		
		</ul>
		
		
        <h2>Choosing a Case</h2>
		
		<p>

		A smaller case can be used but i highly recommend a large case in any circumstance
		since you will always have room for new parts you decide to add. A smaller case will also be dependent
		upon a smaller motherboard.

		</p>

		<h2>Choosing a CPU</h2>
		
		<p>
		
		The CPU is considered the brains of the computer and will be the main dependent upon how fast your computer will run.
		If you are building a desktop I would suggest anything above 3 ghz clock speed will be sufficient enough, and anything 
		higher will be more expensive, but worth the price. You are able to choose between AMD and Intel, but i would highly recommend intel.
		
		</p>
		
		<h2>Choosing a GPU</h2>
		
		<p>
		
		A GPU is not necessary but becomes a necessity when running graphics intensive games. 
		You will be choosing between two companies products, AMD and Nvidia. Nvidia is known for putting out the better product but at a price.
		AMD is thought of as the up and coming underdog.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Choosing a Motherboard</h2>
		
		<p>
		
		The motherboard will hook up all of your components and keep them working in sync with one another. The
		motherboard you choose is dependent upon what cpu you chose. Make sure they are compatible.
			
		</p>
		
		<h2>Choosing a Power Supply</h2>

		<p>
		
		The power supply should be the most researched item on your list because it can fry your whole system if you choose
		a cheap one.
		
		</p>
		
		<h2>Choosing RAM</h2>
		
		<p>
		
		The amount of RAM and the speed at which it runs come into factor when choosing your memory. But for most systems i would advise
		using 16gb of DDR4 RAM. This will keep you from worrying about if you have enough. 8gb is plenty, 16gb will keep the idea of not 
		enough out of question.
		
		</p>
		
		<h2>Choosing a Harddrive</h2>
		
		<p>
		
		I would advise getting a solid state drive in any circumstance if you can afford it because of the blazing fast speed I have 
		noticed when booting up my computer to simple applications.
		
		</p>
		
		<h2>Choosing a Monitor</h2>
		
		<p>
		
		Finally when choosing a monitor I would suggest a 1080p monitor that fits your needs, and if you do decide to get a monitor 
		that has a very high resolution, make sure your gpu is compatible and will be able to handle it.
		
		</p>

		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		
		<p>
		
		If you do decide to build your own computer I wish you the best and only hope my guide helped enlighten you to what is 
		necessary to build a computer.
